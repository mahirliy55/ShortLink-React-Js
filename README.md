# Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge üéØ

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the ***shrtcode API*** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

***shrtcode API*** - GET https://api.shrtco.de/v2/shorten?url={any-url-link}



Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


### Note ‚ùó 

* The response from api can come after a long time, thats why you need to show some spinner or loading svg , so user will know that response is still coming 
* Modal window for LogIn or SignUp has to use state for toggling this window.
